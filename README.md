# Dropbox Paper Source Plugin for Gatsby

Use this plugin to pull data from a [Dropbox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/) account into a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site or application.

## Installation

1. Run `npm install gatsby-source-dropbox-paper`.

2. Get an access token for your Dropbox account, which can be generated [here](https://dropbox.github.io/dropbox-api-v2-explorer).

3. In your `gatsby-config.js` file, add the plugin and the access token to the `plugins` array:

```js
plugins: [
    {
        resolve: "gatsby-source-dropbox-paper",
        options: {
            access_token: "your-access-token"
    }
]
```

You're all set!

## Usage

### Setting Output Format

By default, data will be pulled in Markdown format, but you may also specify "html" by including a `format` option:

```js
plugins: [
    'gatsby-plugin-react-helmet',
    {
        resolve: "gatsby-source-dropbox-paper",
        options: {
            access_token: "your-access-token",
            format: "html"
        }
    },
},
```

### Querying for Data

You can use the following GraphQL fields to pull raw data into your pages.

```graphql
{
  allDropboxPaperDocument(limit: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        content
        doc_id
        owner
        title
        created_date
        status {
          _tag
        }
        revision
        last_updated_date
        last_editor
        id
        internal {
          type
          content
          contentDigest
          owner
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Get Transformed Markdown

Using the [gatsby-transformer-remark](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/) plugin, you can access pulled Markdown transformed into HTML. Simply use the `childMarkdownRemark` field when querying for data.

```graphql
{
  allDropboxPaperDocument(limit: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        childMarkdownRemark {
          id
          html
          excerpt
          timeToRead
          wordCount {
            paragraphs
            sentences
            words
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuring Retries On Failure

The Dropbox Paper API is not always responsive when requesting a document's metadata or the HTML and markdown. This plugin now supports configurable retrying with a modifiable delay:

```js
plugins: [
    {
        resolve: "gatsby-source-dropbox-paper",
        options: {
            access_token: "your-access-token",
            format: "html",
            maxRetryCount: 3, //defaults to 5 retries per API request
            retryDelayMs: 100, //defaults to 0
            shouldRetry: true //defaults to false, needs to be true for the prior two options to work
        }
    },
},
```

## The Future

Right now, this plugin pulls _all_ documents from an authenticated account, which is less than ideal. Improvements will come with changes to this plugin, as well as the evolution of the [Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers), which has limited capabilities in terms of filtering documents to be pulled. Here's what I'd like to see in the future:

- The ability to pull documents by status.
- The ability to pull documents by specific directory.
- Other stuff.
